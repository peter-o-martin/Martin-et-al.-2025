## Directory
This GitHub repository contains the R code (R version 4.4.1 – Race for Your Life[^1]), finalized dataset (i.e., the dataset produced after performing imputation of missing values and adding in additional variables), and the generalized additive models produced through the methodological workflow described in detail in Martin et al. (2025). The different parts of the repository are as follows:

1. **Coding Workflow** folder: this folder contains the six R scripts that were used to process the raw data files, impute left-censored concentration values, finalize the data frame, create generalized additive models for the concentrations of six PFAS (PFOS, PFNA, PFDA, PFUnA, PFDoA, and PFTrDA), test the models (using 80:20 holdout validation along with a supplementary validation data set), and generate figures and tables. The files within this folder are:
    - **Step_1_Data_Import_and_Spatial_Join.R** - Imports the raw data files (initially 3,418 data points collected across 53 studies surveying a total of 79 PFAS), conducts a spatial join, with our custom shapefile of the Great Lakes watersheds, to assign watershed designations and remove points outside the study area (final count of 2,489 samples collected across 50 studies), and performs some initial formatting of the data frame
    - **Step_2_Imputation.R** - Performs imputation of left-censored concentrations (i.e., values entered as "less than a limit of detection or quantification") for 10 PFAS (PFOS, PFDS, PFEtCHxS, PFNA, PFDA, PFUnA, PFDoA, PFTrDA, PFTeDA, and PFPeDA) that met our initial criteria for inclusion: a detection frequency ≥ 60%, at least 3 quantified samples for each watershed, and at least two watersheds represented in the contaminant's samples. Two algorithms (from the zCompositions package[^2]) are used in imputation: a log-ratio Expectation-Maximization Algorithm, from the function lrEM(), and a log-ratio Data Augmentation Algorithm, from the function lrDA(). Because lrDA() will produce slightly different imputed estimates each time the algorithm is run, the finalized imputation results that were going to be used in modeling, generated on July 12th, 2024 with Version 1.5.0-4 of the zCompositions package, were saved as a .csv file (**Finalized_Concentration_Values_07_12_2024.csv**) to be loaded in during the next step
    - **Step_3_Additional_Variables.R** - Finalizes the data frame that will be used in modeling: (i) Additional variables (e.g., _Revised_Tissue_, _Composite_, _Trophic_Level_, _Waterbody_Type_, _Water_Level_, etc.) are inserted into the data frame, (ii) the data frame's columns are reordered, (iii) the imputed concentration values to be used in modeling (saved in **Finalized_Concentration_Values_07_12_2024.csv**) are attached to the data frame, and (iv) extraneous columns are removed from the data frame, including the four contaminants (PFDS, PFEtCHxS, PFTeDA, and PFPeDA) that do not meet our final criterion for modeling (i.e., a detection frequency ≥ 80%). The finalized data frame is saved as **Finalized_Imputed_Data_Frame.csv**
    - **Step_4_Supplementary_Validation_Dataset.R** - Contains all code used to format the supplementary validation data (i.e., the set of 8 raw data points that will be used with the test data set during modeling to assess the predictive accuracy of our models). The same procedures used in Step 3 are employed here, and the finalized data frame is saved as **Finalized_Supp_Validation_Data_Frame.csv**
    - **Step_5_Modeling.R** - Constructs generalized additive models for the six selected analytes: PFOS, PFNA, PFDA, PFUnA, PFDoA, and PFTrDA). Models are built and evaluated using 80:20 holdout validation (80% training and 20% test data), using a number of functions provided by the mgcv[^3], caret[^4], gratia[^5], car[^6], and DHARMa[^7] packages, along with the supplementary validation data frame produced from Step 4. The six finalized models are saved in the **Models** folder
    - **Step_6_Results_and_Figures.R** - Extracts summary statistics and concentration estimates from the six models, and constructs the majority of tables and figures that are presented in the main text and supplementary information of this project. Tables and figures are saved in the **Tables and Figures** folder, using the ggsave() function from the ggplot2 package[^8]

2. **Great Lakes Shapefiles** folder: this folder contains the finalized shapefile, **GL_Watershed_shapefile.shp**, that was used to assign data points to one of the five watersheds of the Great Lakes, as well as to remove any points that fell outside the Great Lakes watersheds. This finalized vector layer, created with QGIS software version 3.36.0 – Maidenhead[^9], cobmines information from shapefiles characterizing the Great Lakes subbasins[^10] and the Saint Lawrence River[^11].

3. **Models** folder: this folder contains the six finalized generalized additive models produced from Step 5, saved as .Rdata files. The estimates produced by these models are reported in the main text and supplement of Martin et al. (2025)
   
4. **Tables and Figures** folder: this folder stores the majority of tables and figures that are presented in the main text and supplementary information of Martin et al. (2025). Specifically, in addition to the first half of the graphical abstract (**Conceptual_Figure.png**), this folder contains Figure 1-4 and S3-S7, the relative concentration (%) sections of Table 2 and S5-S6, and a visual from Step 1 (**Step_1_Visual.png**) of the distribution of all 3,418 initial samples prior to any data frame formatting

5. **Finalized_Concentration_Values_07_12_2024.csv** file: this file contains the finalized imputation results, generated and saved on July 12th, 2024 with Version 1.5.0-4 of the zCompositions package[^2], that were derived from the output of the lrEM() and lrDA() functions for 10 initial contaminants (PFOS, PFDS, PFEtCHxS, PFNA, PFDA, PFUnA, PFDoA, PFTrDA, PFTeDA, and PFPeDA) and that were used to generate the six models (for PFOS, PFNA, PFDA, PFUnA, PFDoA, and PFTrDA) reported in this project

6. **Finalized_Imputed_Data_Frame.csv** file: this file stores the finalized data frame used in modeling. A total of 2,489 samples from 50 studies are included in the file, and those samples have been heavily formatted (including going through the process of imputation) to achieve the end product reported here. Concentration values are directly taken from **Finalized_Concentration_Values_07_12_2024.csv**. For a thorough description of the different variables included in the data frame, please see the Supplementary Information (Text S1-2, Table S1-3). The data frame has not been reviewed or approved by agencies or entities that may have been involved in the individual studies included in the meta-analysis. For copies of the original raw data files, we recommend contacting the corresponding authors of the appropriate papers and/or accessing the data portals where those files are available. The data sources we used for this project, along with full citations for the 50 included studies, are provided in the Supplementary Information (Table S1).

7. **Finalized_Supp_Validation_Data_Frame.csv** file: this file contains the set of 8 formatted data points that are used with the test set in Step 5 to assess the predictive accuracy of the six generalized additive models. The set of included variables, as well as the general formatting, mirror **Finalized_Imputed_Data_Frame.csv**

8. **PFAS_Review_supportingFunctions.R** file: this R script contains a couple of custom functions, collect.frames() and exp10(), that were utilized by the scripts found in the **Coding Workflow** folder. In particular, collect.frames() was used in **Step_1_Data_Import_and_Spatial_Join.R** to read in and bind the 53 raw .csv data files (from the 53 initial studies) together into one data frame that could be formatted and saved for subsequent steps in the workflow

## Summary
If you want to access the complete, finalized and imputed data frame used in modeling, the endpoint of the workflow for this meta-analysis, download **Finalized_Imputed_Data_Frame.csv**. You can also download **Finalized_Supp_Validation_Data_Frame.csv** and bind the two files together to assemble the full breadth of samples (n = 2,497) compiled by the authors. If you wish to acess the six generalized additive models reported in the publication, download the files found in the **Models** folder. And finally, if you wish to repeat/verify the entire workflow of this project, clone the entire repository and execute the scripts in the **Coding Workflow** folder: as long as the setwd() line at the top of each script correctly specifies the path to the repository on your local computer, and as long as the correct version of R[^1] is installed, along with all the packages listed in each script (specifically the versions of those packages that were available in early July of 2024, see Main Text and Supplementary Information for more specific version information), the code should run without any errors.
