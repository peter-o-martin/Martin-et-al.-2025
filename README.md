<h1>Spatial-Temporal Patterns of Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) in the Biota of the Laurentian Great Lakes: A Meta-Analysis (Leyerle Martin et al., 2025)</h1>

This GitHub repository contains the R code, finalized dataset (i.e., the dataset produced after performing imputation of missing values and adding in additional variables), and the generalized additive models produced through the methodological workflow described in detail in Leyerle Martin et al. (2025). The different parts of the repository are as follows:

1. **Great Lakes Shapefiles** folder: this folder contains the finalized shapefile, GL_Watershed_shapefile.shp, that was used to assign data points to one of the five watersheds of the Great Lakes, as well as to remove any points that fell outside the Great Lakes watersheds. This finalized vector layer, created with QGIS software version 3.36.0 – Maidenhead[^1], cobmines information from shapefiles characterizing the Great Lakes subbasins[^2] and the Saint Lawrence River[^3].
